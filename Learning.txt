Docker file: 
A typical docker file consists of these steps

1) creation of base docker image. this typically depends on what programming language are you using to build the app.

FROM golang:1.21 as base

2) setting up working directory in container image i.e., in which folder your app file is placed in image created above.

WORKDIR /APP

3) Copying go.mod and go.sum files to the working directory. this changes from programme to programme.

COPY go.mod ./

4) in go.mod file you speccify few dependencies. they must be downloaded onto the image.

Run go mod download.

5) once the dependencies are upto date now you copy your source code to working directory.

COPY ..

6) build the app from source code and put it in the same directory you are currently in.
RUN go build -o main .



These are typical steps in creating a Docker file. to decrease the size of the docker image you can use multi stage builds and distroless/base

FROM gcr.io/distroless/base
